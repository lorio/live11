            <h2 class="title">The Unwelcome Dinner</h2> <p>It was intended to have been a delicious dinner invitation.<br>
            Posh, in a hotel, in The Hague,<br>
            with alumni from my old university.<br>
            Five courses, two glasses of wine free, seventy-five euros.</p>
            <p>I could meet some people I would never normally see!<br>
            Book well in advance, said the letter,<br>
            to avoid disappointment.<br>
            Cancel with two days’ notice or we’ll have to charge you.</p>
            <p>Otherwise you’ll have to pay<br>
            I turned it over night and day – <br>
            I’d booked – but was my heart really in it, this classy binge?<br>
            Was it really me?</p>
            <p>At the last moment<br>
            I didn’t go.<br>
            Paid for not going.<br>
            Paid for no dinner.</p>
            <p>It was worth the price.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Reading the Poet as his Poetry</h2>
            <p>decided to take a look <br>
            at the poet not the poetry</p>
            <p>to read the poet <br>
            as his poetry</p>
            <p>gave him three marks out of ten<br>
            for lifestyle</p>
            <p>hardly an innovator,<br>
            though he made a great nuisance of himself</p>
            <p>raided the larder at 1 am <br>
            for supplies of marmite-flavoured twiglets</p>
            <p>committed mixed metaphor <br>
            in relationships</p>
            <p>mistook people for each other<br>
                kissed his enemies</p>
            <p>did he influence <br>
                future generations</p>
            <p>did he pass on the message <br>
                of the great tradition</p>
            <p>adding his own thumbprint <br>
                to magnificence</p>
            <p>no he came down <br>
                late for breakfast</p>
            <p>forgot to return <br>
                borrowed money</p>
            <p>on his bicycle <br>
                knocked down old ladies with shopping carts</p>
            <p>his poetry was marvellous<br>
                passed him </p>
            <p>like an Aston Martin <br>
                on the motorway </p>
            <p>leaving him standing<br>
                no apparent connection
            </p>
