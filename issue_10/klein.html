            <h2 class="title">Circular Runes</h2>
            <p>It knew it was a fortune and initial-<br>
              only itself, for all that came before<br>
              was not this fortune.</p>
            <p>It tended to become big with baloney<br>
              though it would walk often watching<br>
              its feet- the fact that it had meat<br>
              made of this an ox who drew lines in the earth.</p>
            <p>Take to this a hammer. Or if nature made a branch<br>
              nearby to a rock and if in the ox's line<br>
              it so happens the branch come across<br>
              a rock and if this makes an impression<br>
              on the ox- a thorn is born. A hand is born-</p>
            <p>And some would say a man is born but he isn't man-like yet.<br>
              Taking elements and shaping them together Birthing<br>
              is born, the brain is born, he who makes<br>
              is born. He finds a branch then finds what made this-<br>
              he finds a tree<br>
              and builds with this his reach-</p>
            <p>A chariot conveys this way.<br>
              Before we knew each other but we didn't<br>
              know who or what 'who' had to be<br>
              necessarily. Moving- yes. He can write,<br>
              he can move it from his hand<br>
              to your head. He can mark wood<br>
              with a word. He can make you see incompletely</p>
            <p>and so starts the world burning<br>
              incompletely- the outer rags written.<br>
              They said to burn them. Torch each word.<br>
              This world had six elements<br>
              and fragmentation.<br>
              There was suspicion- they said, 'kill him'.<br>
              He hid in his hat.<br>
              His hat began to burn.</p>
            <p>And in burning he was lifted<br>
              being above it he was saved<br>
              The body went away<br>
              a gift remained. It moved<br>
              under ash like a bump in a landscape.<br>
              This gift had him come back<br>
              for it was something he could not conceive.<br>
              It was a new<br>
              being.</p>
            <p>And because it could not speak at first<br>
              it was joy. A return to pre-word<br>
              was the world-joy unapart.<br>
              He would hold this to be whole.<br>
              He would heat it and feed it<br>
              and take to it what of earth<br>
              he could find and he would hide<br>
              it from beasts when he needed to leave it alone.<br>
              Beasts sensed this<br>
              and resented it.</p>
            <p>Stones of ice fell from the sky.<br>
              He with joy cannot hide<br>
              from those in need.<br>
              He is pursued, he is chased<br>
              and forced to reveal his life-gift.<br>
              He is frightened for it.<br>
              That is should be battered<br>
              or become perpetually in need<br>
              like those beings who would pull it<br>
              to pieces. He fights until exhausted.<br>
              His life-gift he buries and land grows over it at a madcap rate.</p>
            <p>Enter the ice.<br>
              Hiding moving,<br>
              hiding time.<br>
              So, separated, the life-gift stopped<br>
              while he climbed.<br>
              he left<br>
              many words<br>
              to the life-gift.<br>
              The year was silent.<br>
              DO<br>
              NOT<br>
              THINK</p>
            <p>You will see I have grown smaller than a bead,<br>
              though my feet are big as stars and my hair<br>
              can fill the universe. As a small drop<br>
              of water flows into a tree.<br>
              From the ice I have come to moving again<br>
              choosing a corridor from the forest floor.<br>
              I am drunk by one Yew tree.<br>
              Thee tree who did not crash<br>
              took me<br>
              from ice<br>
              though by ash sown<br>
              the seed<br>
              saved like he from the fire.</p>
            <p>As by fire they were pured<br>
              so by water I am pured.<br>
              Knowing holding<br>
              having been held.<br>
              Knowing going I went<br>
              to a memory preserve.<br>
              A strange communication<br>
              form the north as leaves<br>
              seem to return mirth- a consolation.<br>
              Happy to have shown you<br>
              needed a green spark<br>
              to show you<br>
              something else grows<br>
              inside an earthen bowl.</p>
            <p>From the forest comes an elk<br>
              and on his branches sky-feeling<br>
              and in his eyes<br>
              come hunters<br>
              and for a fawn<br>
              remote instinct<br>
              as from need grows some ability.<br>
              This will not live indoors<br>
              nor be well made<br>
              for machines.<br>
              You can accept his strength<br>
              is more than equal to yours.<br>
              You will eat<br>
              his flesh after<br>
              draining his blood.</p>
            <p>Such is what the sun does<br>
              coming to the surface.<br>
              Blood being the current and course<br>
              of your life through time.<br>
              Your life comes up<br>
              to meet the sun.<br>
              You like<br>
              rare heat.<br>
              A hot spring.<br>
              The sun has hidden<br>
              too in the center<br>
              an energy store.<br>
              Only words could make<br>
              possible an instant<br>
              still place<br>
              in the forest.</p>
            <p>Above all this<br>
              a construction holds the sky<br>
              in place. A birch tree<br>
              sees to silver- a sense<br>
              takes sticks,<br>
              puts words there<br>
              to burn the words.<br>
              The birched word conjured<br>
              to be purged.<br>
              My life looks at this work<br>
              with fear. It can<br>
              never really<br>
              be part of anything<br>
              nor is it ever out of the way.<br>
              The name is stated.<br>
              He is called to claim me;<br>
              to put me in a form further out..</p>
            <p>He does not show caring.<br>
              I do not show caring.<br>
              I act the fire cycle:<br>
              In my dream, I fight a horse child<br>
              for a prestigious prize while<br>
              a large shark eats some of me<br>
              unseen. I perceive and see nothing.<br>
              Then he comes back. Appearing<br>
              on water. A numinous float,<br>
              a mail barge, the letter says,<br>
  &quot;There's no beating the oven.<br>
              You can leave with your one life.<br>
              That is, if you will have life.<br>
              A basket on a river.<br>
              Ice and downhill motion.<br>
              Attached, unattached. No one<br>
              is permanently frozen.&quot;<br>
              So my time keeping ends this way.</p>
            <p>The clay and indentation earth folds to a new day.<br>
              What can be taken will be taken home finally.</p>
