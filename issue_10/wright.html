            <h2 class="title">Thoughts of A Solitary Farmhouse</h2> 
            <p>He had been thinking how good it would be not to have so much fear about
              dying, not to take it so personally. He was sixty years old. He was no
              longer suffering from a shattering, much dreaded disease, he was suffering
              from death, he was dying of death. I want to speak of this frankly, from an
              open heart, and get it over with, look at me, he had cried, or thought he
              had. Why should I waste one more minute on my absence when I am standing
              right here? What's it about, when you boil it all down? Nothing, it's
              nothing but the force we exert all our lives to exclude death from our minds
              confronting us, when it does arrive, as the horror of being excluded — he was
              sure it went something like that. The Canadian wind coming in off Lake Erie
              rattling the windows, violently forcing the front and back doors. This got
              us his attention, and he looked up; but I can't understand how he managed. 
              Seeing as he wasn't there. And neither was his other you, desolate sister,
              Christ-haunted child davening slowly, spider at work on its primer in a
              distant corner, the horizontal snow hour after hour, all the black highways
              that led to his door, once, deleted. Let's try not to worry about it so
              much, he whispered. It's just one day out of your life — one moment out of
            your day­ . . . . </p>
